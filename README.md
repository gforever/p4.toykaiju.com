Project 4


    1-2 paragraph description of your application
    A bulleted list of features your application includes
    What aspects of your application are being managed by JavaScript
    Any additional information the graders may need to know about using your app (for example, if certain features can only be seen by an admin, provide test admin credentials)

My application is a simple todo list. I have created a new database toykaiju_p4 and added additional columns to the posts table. 

Users can add a task via Ajax, and edit or delete task via php. 
Each task contains a title(required) and a detail section (optional). Javascript is used to flag the task as urgent by changing the css. 
MySQL call setup so that the logged in user can only see his/her tasks. 

Currently working on: 
Javascript is used to cross off or uncross off an item from the todo list when .click() is activated. 

Admin has the ability to delete user. (Not sure if I have time to implement???)
Admin username is: admin
Admin password is: cscie15
