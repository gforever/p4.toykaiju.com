    What aspects of your application are being managed by JavaScript
    Any additional information the graders may need to know about using your app (for example, if certain features can only be seen by an admin, provide test admin credentials)

My application is a simple todo list. 

Users can add item, edit item, or delete item. 

Users can follow one another to see other worklists if permission granted by the host user. 
The work lists will be sorted by the user. 

Javascript is used to cross off or uncross off an item from the todo list when .click() is activated. 

Admin has the ability to delete user. 
Admin username is: admin
Admin password is: cscie15
